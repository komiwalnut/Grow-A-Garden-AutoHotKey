**⚠️ Important Note for Dig-Pan.ahk**: Since player stats and game mechanics are dynamic and vary between players, you may need to adjust the timing delays in the Dig-Pan.ahk script to match your specific character's stats and preferences. The current timings are set as defaults but may not be optimal for all players.

## Safety Features

All scripts include several safety mechanisms:

- **Interrupt Protection**: All functions check the running state and can be stopped immediately with F2
- **Safe Movement**: Mouse movements include position validation
- **Controlled Timing**: Built-in delays prevent overwhelming the game interface
